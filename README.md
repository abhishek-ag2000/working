The platform used is Python- Django which  is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. The modular design was the need of the hour and the compatibility with machine learning models such as tensorflow and scikit learn which comprise a major core feature across all products was the main concern behind choosing django over node,js.
Although there are concerns over the speed of the platform hence future migrations to other platforms such as node,js , React.js , Ruby is a possibility.
